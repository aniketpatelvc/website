        <h2>Investor ∩ Builder ∩ Networker</h2>
        <p>My background spans VC, community building, and creative side-projects — but the throughline is simple: I like turning ideas into something real, fast. I’m especially drawn to people and spaces with energy, curiosity, and just enough chaos.</p>
